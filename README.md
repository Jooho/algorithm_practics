# Python Project
This is python practice project. Basically, I started to learn python from 1th Feb 2018.
After that day, I watch python basic clips for 6 days and now I am trying to implement algorithm with python for practise.

My goal is 1commit per day.


## Environment
Python version: 3.x
## Algorithm
### Recursive
Each python may have 2 ways(iteration and recursive)

- [Print string forward/backward](./algorithm/Recursive/1.print_string.py)
- [Sequence Search](./algorithm/Recursive/2.seq_search.py)
- [Convert integer to binary](./algorithm/Recursive/3.convert_to_binary.py)
- [Sum of numbers in a list](./algorithm/Recursive/4.list_sum.py)
- [Find the max number in a list](./algorithm/Recursive/5.find_max.py)
- [Maze Gae](./algorithm/Recursive/6.maze_game.py)
